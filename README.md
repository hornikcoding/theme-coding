# theme-coding
Content coding tobacco media content for 4 themes: Health, Addiction, Policy, and Youth.

Our project coded long-form texts, Twitter, and YouTube videos collected from 2014-2017 for each of these themes. 

Long-form texts came from (1) the AP wire, (2) top 50+ US newspapers, (3) broadcast news transcripts from 8 channels -- each pulled from Lexis-Nexis, and (4) website articles on popular websites among 12-24 year olds according to Nielsen -- pulled with the help of MIT's MediaCloud.
